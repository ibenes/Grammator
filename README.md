# Grammator
Translates SRGS XML format into an AT&amp;T described WFST.

It is thus useful for anyone who is trying to recognize speech using WFST-based recognizer (e.g. Kaldi), but has the set of acceptable utterances described in the SRGS format.

The algorithm applied is described in bachelor thesis of the first author: [Finite State Grammars as Language Models
for Automatic Speech Recognition](https://wis.fit.vutbr.cz/FIT/st/rp.php/rp/2013/BP/16440.pdf).
